<font face="Arial"><b><i>The probably most prominent Swiss computer-science pioneer
retires. Niklaus Wirth takes a proud, yet wistful look back on
his career.</i></b>
</font></center>
<font face="Arial"> </font><p>
<font face="Arial">Grey is the color of the functional-oriented computer-science
building at ETH-Zürich -- like the color of the cells that fill the heads of
computer-scientists,  but what a difference! Although the sober
architecture of the building barely manages to stimulate the imagination,
the brains at work in these bare rooms still produce genial ideas.
Niklaus Wirth is one of the innovators.
The professor at the Institute for Computer Systems
set new scientific standards with his programming languages and
computers. In the sixties, he based the then chaotic world of computer
programming to a clear, comprehensive foundation.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">With the programming language Pascal, which he finished in 1970, Wirth
accomplished what made him famous world-wide. Pascal, named in
reverence of the French mathematician of the seventeenth
century, was the first programming language based on a clear and uniform
structure, making it the language of choice for education. Pascal's
great break-through came in the second half of the seventies, when the
first micro-computers from Apple and Commodore hit the market. Countless
schools around the globe installed Pascal on their machines...
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Since then, Wirth has perfected his systematic approach and developed
the programming languages Modula and Oberon as the successors of Pascal.
But he was also interested in hardware design.
Only when hard- and software are in tune, it is
possible to create user-friendly solutions.
With this in mind,
he developed the computers called Lilith, Ceres, and Chamaeleon.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">At the end of March 1999, Niklaus Wirth will vacate his office in the
computer-science building, retiring at the age of 65 like all other
Swiss civil servants.
Yet Wirth was not the typical confederate civil servant.
Uncompromising -- for some of his collegues sometimes somewhat puritan
or even obstinate -- he followed his goal: to turn the computer into a
productive working tool for everybody.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Systematic, methodic, and structured, these three academic-sounding terms
always show up in his discourse when he talks about hard- and software,
i.e., computer systems should be simple, understandable and clear.
With these requirements, he sees himself far from the mainstream. He is
convinced that "swimming against the tidal wave of main stream
is one of the oldest tasks of a university."
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Today's computer-science landscape looks like a uniform desert: a
handfull of companies, like Microsoft, Intel, IBM, and Compaq control the
global mass market.
Yet in Wirth's view, today's popular software products are
labyrinths, forcing users to move around with innumerable mouse
clicks, finding the exit only out of dumb luck.
The highly popular text-processing software, Word,
is one example of a very complex system, with
millions of lines of code, sprinkled with uncountable errors.
 </font></p><p>
</p><h4><font face="Arial">Harsh words for the industry</font></h4>
<font face="Arial"> </font><p>
<font face="Arial">"Reliable and transparent programs are usually not in the interest of the
designer", continues Wirth.
The marketing departments of the software giants
had noticed that potential customers are not lured by simplicity.
Peoples are fascinated by cool features which nobody really
needs, but can be shown-off proudly to friends.
"The wishes of the users count more than their needs", he concludes.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the trend towards faster personal computers
and more complex programs seems unstoppable.
Yet for Wirth, next to the technical limitations,
there are also human limitations: "Our heads are no longer
capable to process everything."
Even the scientific community is showing
signs of turning towards simplicity and clarity -- Wirth's conservative
credo.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Wirth, being a sharp and critical analayst,
is also critical of artificial intelligence.
Although this is a fascinating field,
it has been promising results for the past 40 years -- without success.
"Constructing computers with human characteristics is nonsense", says Wirth.
The possibilities of technology are generally overestimated,
one of the reasons being the decline of physics and chemistry classes
in public schools.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Sometimes the retiree feels like a caller without voice;
even his two daughters weren't fascinated by a
technical education and his son became a musician.
"Maybe I was a frightening example", shrugs Wirth,
who during his career consequently went his own way.
With a diploma in electronical engineering from the ETH,
he left Switzerland in 1959.
At the renowned Universiy of California at
Berkley, he graduated in software engineering and
finally was an assistant professor at the Stanford University.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">After eight years in the US, Wirth returned to Switzerland with his family,
tempted by an offer from the ETH-Zürich to create a computer-science group.
Despite the triumph with Pascal, Switzerland didn't seem to be a too
fertile ground for computer-science. "Sometimes frustrating", says
Wirth, who built the Lilith computer between 1977 and 1980.
The powerful workstation was one of the first to have a mouse,
a high-resolution monitor, and a graphical user interface.
In comparison, at this time, the Apple II seemed almost traditional,
equipped only with a keyboard as input device.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">But the Lilith brought Wirth no comercial success.
The industry was cautious and unwilling to take any risks
and the project for a commercial production was quickly abandoned.
"The opportunity to build a computer industry in our country was then lost",
says Wirth.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Teaching computer-science in Switzerland was still in its infancy.
While the US introduced computer-science courses already in 1965,
the ETH only decided to follow suit in 1980, twelve years after
Wirth's return to Switzerland.
Many initiatives,
which he and his colleague Carl August Zehnder submitted before,
were ignored.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Yet such deceptions didn't stop Wirth from doing research and teaching.
Landmarks of his work in the eighties were the Ceres computer and the
Oberon operating system, which allowed an uncomplicated dialog between
the user and the computer. Lately the computer-science pioneer has been
working on the edge of hard- and software and has developed tools for
field programmable semiconductors (FPGAs).
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">A career with seven honorary doctorates and many honors,
driven out of curiosity and thirst for knowledge since
his early years, comes to an end.
Niklaus Wirth grew up in Winthertur, beside the
high-school where his father taught geography.
The only child found his inspiration in his fathers library.
Filled with technical works, he found descriptions of turbines,
steam-engines, locomotives and telegraphs -- the technology fascinated him.
Yet the theory alone was not enough for the student,
he wondered how everything would work in real life.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">In a group of model airplane hobbyists he built airplanes of his own
design together with friends - more than two dozens,
the largest with a wing-span of 3.5 meters.
In high-school Wirth was fascinated by chemistry.
At home he built a laboratory in his basement to try out on his own
what he had learnt at school.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">His blue eyes twinkle as the professor laughs like a little boy while
telling an anecdote about an unfortunate model-rocket experiment.
He and a friend had not sufficiently compressed the fuel mix of
potassium-perchlorine, sulfur, and carbon.
The projectile missed it's planned
trajectory and landed at the principal's feet,
who had just come around a corner of the school.
No disciplinary measures were taken.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">"An unencumbered time", recalls the Universiy Professor, who during
his academic career, nevertheless was able to realise most of his ideas.
Fundamental research provided him with the much needed space to create
new knowledge - without having to think about marketing any
of the potential achievements. Tempi passati.
 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Time has changed in science. Professors are now managers and
orientate themselves towards market tendencies, such as Anton Gunzinger
with his super-computers. Wirth still has problems with commercialisation,
having always pointedly preached for a clear separation between industry and
education combined with research.
Yet now the universities must be efficiently managed and profitable.
That's the new government policy.
"It's a devastating perspective,
if university reasearch has to show short-term benefits," says Wirth sadly,
favoring full academic freedom.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Yet the digital contrarian will remain independent -- in
retirement. He wishes to find more muse, return to building model
aircraft and reading.
Above all he loves detective stories.
Wirth can't get away from logical combination.
