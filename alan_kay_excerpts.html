new thing. Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would
come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all
thought that the next level of programming language would be much more <font color="#00ff80"><b>strategic</b></font> and even <font color="#00ff80"><b>policy-oriented</b></font> and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. <i><b>But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation
actually didn't show up.</b></i> One could actually argue -- as I sometimes do -- that <b><i>the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually
led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects.</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You could think of it as putting a low-pass filter on some of the good ideas
from the '60s and '70s, as <font color="#ffffff"><b><i>computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people
can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a <font size="+1">pop culture</font></i></b></font>, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its
inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But
they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to
understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as
they were.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real
software engineering today, is partly due to this <font size="+1">pop culture</font>.</div></font><br><br><font color="white" face="times new roman" size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=273&amp;page=1"><b><font color="#ffffff">"A Conversation with Alan Kay"</font></b></a> (adapted)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Programming Languages</i> (Vol. 2, No. 9 - Dec/Jan 2004-2005)</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><hr width="95%" align="center"><br><br><br><table bgcolor="grey" cellpadding="35" align="center"><tbody><tr><td><font purple="" color="#0000d0" face="arial" size="1"><div align="justify">If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering,
it's certainly engineering of a sort -- but it's the kind of engineering that
people without the concept of the arch did. Most software today is very much
like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other,
with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of
slaves.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would compare the Smalltalk stuff that we did in the '70s with something like
a Gothic cathedral. We had two ideas, really. One of them we got from Lisp: <font color="white" size="2"><b>late binding</b></font>. The other one was the idea of <font color="white" size="2"><b>objects</b></font>. Those gave us something a little bit like the arch, so we were able to make
complex, seemingly large structures out of very little material, but I wouldn't
put us much past the engineering of 1,000 years ago.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you look at [Doug] Engelbart's demo [a live online hypermedia demonstration
of the pioneering work that Engelbart's group had been doing at Stanford
Research Institute, presented at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference], then
you see many more ideas about <b>how to boost the collective IQ of groups and help
them to work together</b> than you see in the commercial systems today. I think
there's this very long lag between what you might call the best practice in
computing research over the years and what is able to leak out and be adapted
in the much more expedient and deadline-conscious outside world.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not that people are completely stupid, but if there's a big idea and you
have deadlines and you have expedience and you have competitors, very likely
what you'll do is take a low-pass filter on that idea and implement one part of
it and miss what has to be done next. This happens over and over again. If
you're using early-binding languages as most people do, rather than
late-binding languages, then you really start getting locked in to stuff that
you've already done. You can't reformulate things that easily.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's say the adoption of programming languages has very often been somewhat
accidental, and the emphasis has very often been on how easy it is to implement
the programming language rather than on its actual merits and features. For
instance, Basic would never have surfaced because there was always a language
better than Basic for that purpose. That language was Joss, which predated
Basic and was beautiful. But Basic happened to be on a GE timesharing system
that was done by Dartmouth, and when GE decided to franchise that, it started
spreading Basic around just because it was there, not because it had any
intrinsic merits whatsoever.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This happens over and over again. The languages of Niklaus Wirth have spread
wildly and widely because he has been one of the most conscientious documenters
of languages and one of the earlier ones to do algorithmic languages using <font color="#ffffff"><b>p-codes (pseudocodes)</b></font> -- the same kinds of things that we use. The idea of using
those things has a common origin in the hardware of a machine called the <font color="#ffffff"><b>Burroughs B5000</b></font> from the early 1960s, which the establishment hated.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... I was there, and Burroughs actually hired college graduates to explain that
machine to data-processing managers. There was an immense amount of information
available. The problem was that the DP managers didn't want to learn new ways
of computing, or even how to compute. IBM realized that and Burroughs didn't.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... the original machine [<font color="#ffffff"><b>Burroughs B5000</b></font>] had two CPUs, and it was described quite adequately in a 1961 paper by Bob
Barton, who was the main designer. One of the great documents was called &#8220;The
Descriptor&#8221; and laid it out in detail. The problem was that almost everything
in this machine was quite different and what it was trying to achieve was quite
different.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reason that line lived on -- even though the establishment didn't like it
-- was precisely because it was almost impossible to crash it, and so the
banking industry kept on buying this line of machines, starting with the B5000.
Barton was one of my professors in college, and I had adapted some of the ideas
on the first desktop machine that I did. Then we did a much better job of
adapting the ideas at Xerox PARC <i>(Palo Alto Research Center)</i>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Neither Intel nor Motorola nor any other chip company understands the first
thing about why that architecture was a good idea. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just as an aside, to give you an interesting benchmark -- on roughly the same
system, roughly optimized the same way, a benchmark from 1979 at Xerox PARC
runs only 50 times faster today. <font color="#ffffff"><b>Moore's law</b></font> has given us somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 times improvement in that
time. So there's <b>approximately a factor of 1,000 in efficiency that has been <i>lost</i> by bad CPU architectures</b>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The myth that it doesn't matter what your processor architecture is -- that
Moore's law will take care of you -- is totally false. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... both <font color="#ffffff"><b>Lisp</b></font> and <font color="#ffffff"><b>Smalltalk</b></font> were done in by the eight-bit microprocessor -- it's not because they're
eight-bit micros, it's because the processor architectures were bad, and they
just killed the <font color="#ffffff"><b>dynamic languages</b></font>. Today these languages run reasonably because even though the architectures
are still bad, the level 2 caches are so large that some fraction of the things
that need to work, work reasonably well inside the caches; so both Lisp and
Smalltalk can do their 	things and are viable today. But both of them are quite
obsolete, of course.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The stuff that is in vogue today is only about &#8220;one- half&#8221; of those languages.
Sun Microsystems had the right people to make <font color="#ffffff" size="3"><b>Java</b></font> into a first-class language, and I believe it was <b><i>the Sun marketing people</i></b> who rushed the thing out before it should have gotten out. They <b><i>made it impossible for the Sun software people to do what needed to be done.</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like I said, it's a pop culture. A commercial hit record for teenagers doesn't
have to have any particular musical merits. I think a lot of the success of
various programming languages is expeditious gap-filling. <font color="#ffffff"><b>Perl</b></font> is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and then being a real
problem in the longer term. <b>Basically, a lot of the problems that computing has
had in the last 25 years comes from systems where the designers were trying to
fix some short-term thing and didn't think about <i>whether the idea would scale</i> if it were adopted.</b> There should be a half-life on software so old software
just melts away over 10 or 15 years.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a different culture in the '60s and '70s; the ARPA <i>(Advanced Research Projects Agency)</i> and PARC culture was basically a mathematical/scientific kind of culture and
was interested in <font color="white" face="times new roman" size="3"><b><i>scaling</i></b></font>, and of course, the <font purple="" color="#0000d0" size="3"><b>Internet was an exercise in scaling</b></font>. There are just two different worlds, and I don't think it's even that helpful
for people from one world to complain about the other world -- like people from
a literary culture complaining about the majority of the world that doesn't
read for ideas. It's futile.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't spend time complaining about this stuff, because <font color="#ffffff"><b>what happened in the last 20 years is quite normal, even though it was
unfortunate. Once you have something that grows faster than education grows,
you're always going to get a pop culture.</b></font> It's well known that I tried to kill Smalltalk in the later '70s.
There were a few years when it was the most wonderful thing in the world. It
answered needs in a more compact and beautiful way than anything that had been
done before. But time moves on. As we learned more and got more ambitious about
what we wanted to do, we realized that there are all kinds of things in
Smalltalk that don't <font purple="" color="#0000d0"><b>scale</b></font> the way they should -- for instance, the <font color="#0000ff"><b>reflection</b></font> stuff that we had in there. It was one of the first languages to really be
able to see itself, but now it is known how to do all levels of reflection much
better -- so we should implement that.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We saw after a couple of years that this could be done much better. The <font color="#0000ff"><b>object model</b></font> we saw after a couple of years could be done much better, etc. So the problem
is -- I've said this about both Smalltalk and Lisp -- they tend to eat their
young. What I mean is that both Lisp and Smalltalk are really fabulous
vehicles, because they have a <font color="#ffffff"><b>meta-system</b></font>. They have so many ways of dealing
with problems that the <font color="#ffffff"><b>early-binding languages</b></font> don't have, that it's very, very difficult for people who like Lisp or
Smalltalk to imagine anything else.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now just to mention a couple of things about Java: it really doesn't have a
full <font color="#ffffff"><b>meta-system</b></font>. It has always had the problem -- for a variety of reasons -- of having two
regimes, not one regime. It has things that aren't objects, and it has things
that it calls objects. It has real difficulty in being dynamic. It has a
garbage collector. So what? Those have been around for a long time. But it's
not that great at adding to itself.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For many years, the development kits for Java were done in <font color="#ffffff"><b>C++</b></font>. That is a telling thing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We looked at Java very closely in 1995 when we were starting on a major set of
implementations, just because it's a lot of work to do a viable language <b>kernel</b>. The thing we liked least about Java was the way it was implemented. It
had this old idea, which has never worked, of having a set of paper specs,
having to implement the <font color="#ffffff" size="3"><b>VM</b></font> <i>(virtual machine)</i> to the paper specs, and then having benchmarks that try to validate what
you've just implemented -- and that has never resulted in a completely
compatible system.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The technique that we had for Smalltalk was to write the VM in itself, so
there's a <b>Smalltalk simulator of the VM</b> that was essentially the only specification of the VM. You could debug and you
could answer any question about what the VM would do by submitting stuff to it,
and you made every change that you were going to make to the VM by changing the
simulator. After you had gotten everything debugged the way you wanted, you
pushed the button and it would generate, without human hands touching it, <b><i>a mathematically correct version of C that would go on whatever platform you
were trying to get onto</i></b>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result is that this system today, called <font purple="" color="#0000d0" size="3"><b>Squeak</b></font>, runs identically on more than two dozen platforms. Java does not do that. <i><b>If you think about what the Internet means, it means you have to run
identically on everything that is hooked to the Internet.</b></i> So Java, to me, has always violated one of the prime things about software
engineering in the world of the Internet.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once we realized that Java was likely not to be compatible from platform to
platform, we basically said we'll generate our own system that is absolutely
compatible from platform to platform, and that's what we did.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anybody can do that. If the pros at Sun had had a chance to fix Java, the world
would be a much more pleasant place. This is not secret knowledge. It's just
secret to this pop culture.</div></font><br><br><font face="times new roman" size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

carefully defined in terms of Lisp] -- when I finally understood that the half
page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in
itself. These were <b>"Maxwell's Equations of Software!"</b> This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand
over. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I realized that anytime I want to know what I'm doing, I can just write down
the <b>kernel</b> of this thing in a half page and it's not going to lose any power. In fact,
it's going to gain power by being able to reenter itself much more
readily than most systems done the other way can possibly do.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of these ideas could be part of both software engineering and computer
science, but I fear -- as far as I can tell -- that most undergraduate degrees
in
computer science these days are basically Java vocational training. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I've heard complaints from even mighty Stanford University with its illustrious
faculty that basically the undergraduate computer science program is little
more than Java certification. </div></font><br><br><font face="times new roman" size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

there is a discipline called mathematics, one called science, and one called
engineering, and if those are put in a Venn diagram the intersection of the
three is modern-day technology. Engineering was around a lot longer than
science, but there is very little engineering that is done today that is not
hooked into scientific investigation and scientific results. And math is the
lingua franca for both of these disciplines. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would say that, temperamentally, I am basically an idealist, which makes me
pretty much of a mathematician. Scientists tend to be realists, and engineers
pragmatists. I am much more of an idealist than a realist or a pragmatist. In a
way, when I think of myself, I think of myself as a scientist more than a
mathematician or an engineer, but when I look at what I have done it has been
mostly math and engineering and very little actual science. So these are just
three ways of dealing with those things. </div></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><hr width="95%" align="center"><br><br><font purple="" color="#0000d0" face="times new roman" size="1"></font><blockquote><font purple="" color="#0000d0" face="times new roman" size="1">Check these out:<br><br><li><a href="http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/futures.htm"><b>"Predicting The Future"</b></a> -- By Alan C.
