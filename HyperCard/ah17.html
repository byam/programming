											</div>
											<p class="initial"><a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah16.html#ApplesoftII">Applesoft</a>
 was easy to use because it was interactive. You entered a command, and 
could immediately try it out. The disadvantage was a lack of more 
powerful commands, and it could be difficult to create large and complex
 programs. Efforts were begun within Apple to develop a more 
comprehensive language for the II, one that could be updated and 
modified if necessary. Since Applesoft was in ROM, it was more expensive
 and difficult for the end-user to install any upgrades to that 
language.</p>
											<p>In 1979 Apple Pascal and the Language System was released.
 It sold for the steep price of $495, and came on four 5.25 floppy disks
 (all in the format of the Pascal disk system, of course). It also 
included the ROMs to change 13 sector disk controllers into 16 sector 
controllers, and the <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah12.html#LanguageCard">Language Card</a>
 to plug into slot 0. As discussed previously, the Language Card was a 
16K RAM card that made an Apple II into a full 64K RAM computer. Because
 of the extra available RAM, the Pascal system could load into memory 
without having to avoid the space used by the Applesoft (or <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah16.html#IntegerBasic">Integer BASIC</a>) interpreter. And with some complicated bank switching, even routines in the Monitor could be used if needed.</p>
											<p>Apple chose to use the Pascal standard defined by the 
University of California at San Diego (UCSD). To make portability 
between various different computers possible, UCSD Pascal programs were 
compiled into a specialized code called "P-code". This "P-code" program 
could then be executed on any computer that had a proper interpreter. An
 Apple Pascal program could, then, run a little faster than an Applesoft
 program (since it <i>was</i> compiled), but not as fast as assembly language. The extra power it provided made it an attractive choice for some programmers.</p>
											<p>The earliest version of Apple Pascal got complaints from 
users because it would not support lowercase (for those who had modified
 their Apple to display lowercase), and it was so large that it was 
quite awkward to use by those who owned only one disk drive.</p>
											<p>Since the original UCSD Pascal language was designed to 
work with a full 80 columns of text, this was somewhat of a problem for 
the 40-column Apple II. For those Apple II's that did not have an 
80-column card, Apple Pascal would display half of the screen at a time.
 In the Pascal Editor, entry of a line longer than 40 columns would 
cause the screen to scroll to the left. Using the arrow keys to move 
back to the left would scroll the screen back the other way. If needed, 
you could jump directly to the other half of the screen by pressing 
Ctrl-A.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x1">[1]</a></p>
											<p>The limitation of Apple Pascal came from the need for a 
user to own the Language Card (or one of the later equivalent 16K RAM 
cards), and the fact that it was incompatible with the large library of 
DOS 3.2 programs and files that were already available. Eventually, with
 the proliferation of the 64K Apple IIe and 128K Apple IIc, a platform 
for Pascal applications was available. However, by that time the primary
 disk system being promoted by Apple for the II was <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#ProDOS">ProDOS</a>, and Apple never officially released a version of their original UCSD Pascal that would run under that operating system.</p>
											<p>The Apple Pascal system has evolved up to version 1.3, 
which will support the more advanced features of the Apple IIe and IIc, 
but does not work as well with the IIGS as some would like. Instead, 
IIGS programmers now have versions of Pascal distributed by third party 
companies (like ORCA/Pascal from ByteWorks) created to take full 
advantage of that machine in 16-bit mode.</p>
											<br>
											<div align="left">
												<p class="subhead"><a name="02"></a>INSTANT PASCAL</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">This version of Pascal was written by 
Think Technologies, and Apple later bought the rights to sell it as a 
program for teaching Pascal. It would run only on The Apple IIc or on a 
128K IIe because it used the double hi-res graphics mode, functioning 
much like a Macintosh "desktop" with multiple resizable windows. It had a
 mouse-based editor that checked program syntax as each line was entered
 (as did the older Integer BASIC) and automatically indented lines and 
boldfaced Pascal reserved words. Since it was intended for teaching, it 
also had a single-step trace function and the ability to modify the 
contents of variables while a program was running. Though good for 
learning the language, it was quite slow because of the overhead needed 
to display everything in graphics, and because it was an interpreted 
version of Pascal (instead of a compiled version).</p>
											<p>Fans of the original Apple Pascal complained loudly after 
Apple introduced Instant Pascal. After this new Pascal came out, Apple 
didn't seem motivated to make any further upgrades to the older Pascal, 
which still used the original Pascal disk system format (Instant Pascal 
was made to run directly under ProDOS).<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x2">[2]</a></p>

												<p class="subhead"><a name="03"></a>FORTRAN</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">Released by Apple in 1980, Apple FORTRAN 
ran under the Pascal operating system. It cost $200 (over and above the 
$495 needed to get the Language System). Programs written in FORTRAN for
 other computers could run with little modification under Apple FORTRAN 
(if a user needed that ability). As a compiled language, it ran faster 
than Applesoft, and probably also faster than Pascal, since FORTRAN 
wasn't translated into an intermediate "P-code". Apple's FORTRAN had 
many bugs in it, though, and since its introduction in 1980 it was never
 upgraded. By September 1986 it had disappeared from their product 
catalogs.</p>
											<p>Another way for an Apple II user to get FORTRAN was to buy the Microsoft Z-80 <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah12.html#Softcard">Softcard</a>
 for $345 and Microsoft FORTRAN for $200. This version of FORTRAN was 
more full-featured than Apple's, and offered some advantages in 
usability. It did <i>not</i> require changing to the 16 sector disk 
controller ROMs (if you didn't want to). Also, standard Microsoft BASIC 
(which was more advanced than Applesoft) was included in the Softcard 
package.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x3">[3]</a></p>
											<p><a name="FortranPecan"></a>In June of 1987 Pecan Software released FORTRAN for the IIGS. It ran under <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#ProDOS16">ProDOS 16</a> (<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#GSOS">GS/OS</a>), but still used the UCSD format for its FORTRAN by creating a ProDOS file that acted as a UCSD Volume.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x3">[3]</a></p>

												<p class="subhead"><a name="04"></a>OTHER LANGUAGES</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial"><b>PILOT</b>: Designed primarily for 
creating tutorial modules, this language allowed educators to design 
interactive programs to instruct students and test them on their 
responses during the process. One early version was written in Applesoft
 and was text-based. Apple later released their own version that ran 
under the Pascal system for $125.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x4">[4]</a></p>
											<p><b>FORTH</b>: This was a interesting language described as
 "extensible". It had a number of built-in commands, and new ones could 
be added as easily as typing its definition. These added commands could 
then be used in larger programs. Two versions sold in the late 1970's 
were "Apple Forth 1.6" (Cap'n Software) and "6502 Forth 1.2" (Programma 
International). Apple Forth 1.6 was a good package, but it used a unique
 disk system that was not compatible with <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah14.html#DOS32">DOS 3.2</a>. Programma's Forth was more extensive, but also more complicated.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x5">[5]</a>,<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x6">[6]</a></p>
											<p><a name="Logo"></a><b>LOGO</b>: Developed from LISP (LISt 
Processing) language to be an aid for learning, Logo has been popular 
over the years in the school environment. Apple's first version of Logo 
(which operated under the Pascal system) could run on any 64K Apple II, 
while Apple Logo II (released in July 1984 for $100) ran under ProDOS on
 Apple II's with 128K memory.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x7">[7]</a></p>
											<p><b>COBOL</b>: This language has had limited availability 
for the Apple II. The only version I am aware of was from Microsoft. It 
sold for $599 and ran under the<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#CPM">CP/M</a> system with the Microsoft Z-80 Softcard.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x8">[8]</a></p>
											<p><b>C</b>: A language that is currently popular among 
"power" programmers. It has some of the structure of Pascal, but also 
some of the low-level power of assembly language.</p>
											<br>
											<div align="left">
												<p class="subhead"><a name="05"></a>ASSEMBLERS</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">A large variety of Apple II assemblers 
have been available over the years. The earliest one, of course, was the
 mini-assembler that came with every Integer BASIC Apple II. The one was
 only good for immediate entry of assembly code; if changes were needed,
 much of the code would likely have to be re-entered from the beginning.
 Some other assemblers available in the early days include:</p>
											<p><b>TED/ASM</b>: Developed at Apple and smuggled out the 
doors around May 1978, this assembler had memory conflicts with DOS, so 
they couldn't be used together. The text editor module was written by 
Randy Wigginton, and the assembler was written by Gary Shannon. In the 
early days, it was the only assembler they had available that would run 
on an Apple II.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x9">[9]</a></p>
											<p><b>RANDY'S WEEKEND ASSEMBLER</b>: Also written by Randy 
Wigginton, this one slipped out of Apple in September 1978. The text 
editor was written mostly in SWEET-16 (Wozniak's 16-bit emulator in the 
Integer BASIC ROM), and was therefore slow. Unfortunately, it had its 
own set of bugs.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x9">[9]</a></p>
											<p><b>MICROPRODUCTS ASSEMBLER</b>: The first commercially 
available assembler for the Apple II, this was a "four character 
assembler", meaning that labels (a designation identifying a line or 
variable) could only be four characters long. Later it was expanded to 
work with six character labels. Despite some annoying bugs, it was 
inexpensive at only $39.95.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x10">[10]</a></p>
											<p><b>SC-ASSEMBLER II</b>: Probably the second Apple II 
assembler that was commercially distributed. Externally it was similar 
to the Microproducts assembler, but was better supported and regularly 
upgraded. It was very compact, and achieved that goal by making heavy 
use of SWEET-16 code. Consequently, it was slow when assembling. The 
author, Bob Sander-Cederlof, later started a popular newsletter called 
"Apple Assembly Lines" to both support his product and to be an 
information center for <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah02.html#6502">6502</a> assembly language tips and techniques.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x10">[10]</a></p>
											<p><a name="Bredon1"></a><b>BIG MAC/MERLIN</b>: Sold 
originally by A.P.P.L.E. as "Big Mac", and later under the name "Merlin"
 by Southwestern Data Systems (later known as Roger Wagner Publishing). 
This assembler has been well supported over the years and has been 
extensively upgraded. It is one of the few remaining assemblers that 
have moved on to the <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah10.html#65816">65816</a>
 GS/OS world, while retaining full compatibility with the previous 8-bit
 6502 versions. Currently it is sold as Merlin 816 (including an 8-bit 
version) and Merlin 16+. The author, <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/appy/aha82.html#Bredon2">Glen Bredon</a>, has also done many other programs and utilities for the Apple II.</p>
											<p><b>ORCA/M</b>: Sold by the ByteWorks, the current version 
was chosen by Apple Computer as the official assembler of the APW (Apple
 Programmer's Workshop) programming environment on the IIGS. ByteWorks 
has since expanded its product line to include versions of Pascal, C, 
BASIC, and other IIGS languages.</p>
											<p><b>APPLE EDASM</b>: This was Apple's original "official" 
assembler for the II Plus and later 8-bit Apple II's. Though no longer 
actively supported (ORCA/M having supplanted it in the APW environment),
 the early versions for <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#DOS33">DOS 3.3</a>
 were included on the Apple Toolkit disk, which also had a hi-res 
character generator that could be interfaced into Applesoft programs. 
The early ProDOS versions of EDASM were sold with a 65c02 debugger 
called <b>Bugbyter</b>.</p>
											<p><a name="Huffin"></a><b>UCSD PASCAL ASSEMBLER</b>: Part of
 the Apple Pascal package, it was popular because it had macro 
capability, could do conditional assembly and create relocatable code, 
and had a good text editor. However, programs created with it could not 
be run on a standard (non-Language card) Apple, because there was no 
utility available early on to transfer the files to <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah14.html#DOS32">DOS 3.2</a>. (Later, A.P.P.L.E. published transfer utilities called "HUFFIN" and "PUFFIN" for movement to and from <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#DOS33">DOS 3.3</a>, named affectionately after Apple's "<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#MUFFIN">MUFFIN</a>" utility for DOS 3.2 to 3.3 file transfers).</p>
											<p><b>MISCELLANEOUS OTHER ASSEMBLERS</b>: ASM/65, sold by 
Programma; "EAT" (Edit and Assemble Text) sold by Software Concepts, and
 written in Integer BASIC; and L.I.S.A., sold by Laser Systems.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x10">[10]</a></p>

												<p class="subhead"><a name="06"></a>MACROS VS. SCRIPTS</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">With the increase in complexity of 
applications programs has also come a secondary level of programming. 
This extension has been called a "macro", meaning that a single step 
would accomplish several separate ones that would ordinarily take more 
effort. Early examples of this were available in some <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah15.html#DOS33">DOS 3.3</a>
 utilities, where pressing Ctrl-C from the keyboard (for example) might 
cause the word "CATALOG" to appear on the command line. In this example,
 a macro was used to save keystrokes and speed up repetitive activities.
 Similar macros were available for BASIC programmers, making a control 
key sequence print many of the common BASIC keywords, speeding program 
entry. (This type of macro was different from macros used in some 
assemblers, such as Big Mac/Merlin and the Pascal assembler. Here a 
"macro" was a new command that was defined to represent several standard
 assembly operation codes. This did not shorten the final resulting 
program, but made it possible to more easily enter repeated sequences of
 assembly codes).</p>
											<p>Application programs began to take this concept and 
include a macro capability (either offered with the program or as a 
third-party add-on product). With time, some of these macro features 
have become so complex that they have become programming languages in 
their own right. In fact, many of them are being referred to as 
"scripting" languages, since they "direct" the function of a program, as
 a director uses a script to film a movie. This has been most popular 
with telecommunications programs, where the process of logging on to a 
remote computer, downloading new messages, and uploading replies is 
automated with a script that analyzes the responses from the other 
computer and takes the appropriate action. It has also been popular in 
programs like <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah18.html#AppleWriter"><b>Apple Writer</b></a> (WPL, Word Processing Language) and <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html"><b>AppleWorks</b></a> (<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html#UltraMacros"><b>UltraMacros</b></a>), where each has had its own method of automating repetitive tasks.</p>
											<br>
											<div align="left">
												<p class="subhead"><a name="07"></a>A LEAP IN COMPLEXITY</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">The environment for writing, compiling, 
and debugging programs has evolved along with the applications created 
by those programs. Originally, the Apple II and other computers of the 
day were used in a "command-line interface" environment. This means that
 each command was typed one at a time, and sometimes "batched" together 
to simplify a repetitive process (as with EXEC files under Apple DOS). 
An example of this command-line interface can be found by starting up 
Applesoft (or by using MS-DOS on an IBM). Anything that is to be done 
with this language has to be started by typing the proper command from 
the keyboard. Misspell the word "LOAD", and an error message is printed 
and it will stubbornly refuse to do what you wanted. The same command 
line is used for entering the lines of a BASIC program, or RUNning the 
program. This method was used because it was what programmers of the day
 were accustomed to. Nearly every computer prior to the microcomputer 
reVolution worked in the same way, even if it was done using punched 
cards instead of being typed at a keyboard.</p>
											<p>Minor differences were used from time to time in different
 computer languages, but none really took effect and changed the way in 
which people used computers until the release of the Macintosh in 1984. 
Macintosh used a radically different method of operating a computer. 
Instead of typing each command, the user would point to something on the
 screen and "click" on it using the mouse pointing device. And Macintosh
 programmers extended this concept to every application released with 
it. This different environment has been called a "graphic user 
interface" (GUI), and uses the concept of objects rather than typed 
commands. To delete a file, you don't type "DELETE PROGRAM", but point 
to the picture (icon) representing the file and drag it onto a picture 
of a trash can. This "desktop" includes more complex commands chosen 
from menus that appear in boxes called "windows" that pull down like a 
window shade from command category names on a "menu bar".</p>
											<p>As the command line disappeared, so did traditional 
methods of handling program data. Words were still typed into a document
 on a word processing program, but many of the features that set up 
margins, tabs, and page breaks were translated into graphic icons 
selected with the mouse. Eventually this progressed into the world of 
the programmer. The text of computer program was entered much like any 
word processor text, and the command to compile it into an executable 
program was now selected from the menu bar at the top of the screen.</p>
											<p>A step further along this path is the concept of 
"object-oriented programming" (OOP). In this method, the details of 
windows, menu bars, buttons, and other GUI standards are used to create 
other programs that use a consistent interface. Instead of having to 
laboriously define at the byte level how to create a window box, the 
computer already knows how to do this; the programmer just has to tell 
the computer how big it should be and where to place it on the screen. 
OOP programming allows smaller modules (called "objects") to be used to 
build a more complex final product. A language that works in an OOP 
environment is finally available on an Apple II, but before we get to 
it, a little more introduction is necessary.</p>

											<div align="left">
												<p class="subhead"><a name="08"></a>HYPERTEXT</p>
											</div>
											<p class="initial">The term "hypertext" was created by <u>Computer Lib</u>
 author Ted Nelson, and refers to a method of allowing a user to move 
from one concept to another in a text by linking the two concepts 
together.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x11">[11]</a>
 The first type of program that used "hypertext" was a simple text based
 one. Certain words in the text of a document being viewed were marked 
to indicate that other information about that word was available 
elsewhere. Moving a cursor to that word and pressing a key would jump to
 the additional facts. For example, in an article about the history of 
music, the word "sonata" might be highlighted. Selecting this word could
 jump to another article that discusses sonatas in greater detail. When 
finished, the user could jump back over this link to the place where he 
left off in the original article.</p>
											<p><b>Tutor-Tech</b> was the first comprehensive hypertext 
system available for the Apple II series. It worked on 8-bit Apple II's,
 and was designed primarily for use in a classroom setting. Entirely 
graphics-based, it defined certain parts of the screen as "buttons", and
 moving the pointer to that area could allow the program to move to a 
different screen or cause something else to happen. As with any graphic 
interface, icons that represented certain functions were used to 
designate commands (i.e., to exit the program, you point to a picture of
 door labelled "EXIT").</p>
											<p><a name="HyperCard"></a>In 1986 a remarkable program became available on the Macintosh that was, for a time, included with each Mac sold. <b>HyperCard</b>
 was a comprehensive system that used the idea of hypertext, plus added a
 programming language that consisted of words and phrases as close to 
English as anything else previously available on a microcomputer. The <b>HyperCard</b>
 system took care of the details of how to draw boxes and buttons, and 
left it to the user to define where to put them and how to label them. 
And because of the language (which Apple called "HyperTalk"), user 
actions could do more than just move to a different picture (called a 
"card" by the program). It was possible to design simple databases, 
games, and much more using this system. Because it called a single part 
of an application a "card", a collection of cards comprising an entire 
HyperCard application was called a "stack".</p>
											<p><a name="HyperStudio"></a>With the release of the IIGS, 
the power was finally available in the Apple II world to create a 
similar product. But it didn't come first from Apple Computer; instead, 
Roger Wagner Publishing introduced a product called <b>HyperStudio</b> 
in May of 1989. This program used the super hi-res graphics modes 
accessible on the IIGS to create its own type of stacks. Like <b>HyperCard</b> on the Macintosh, <b>HyperStudio</b>
 used buttons and objects on the screen to direct movement through a 
stack application. It also included a hardware card that made it 
possible to easily digitize sounds to use in stacks. Though more 
extensive than <b>Tutor-Tech</b>, it was not quite as flexible as <b>HyperCard</b>, since it lacked a true programming language.</p>
											<p>In January 1991, Apple released <b>HyperCard IIGS</b>, a 
conversion of the Macintosh product. This finally made a fully 
programmable hypermedia environment possible on the IIGS. Later in the 
year Roger Wagner Publishing responded with an updated version of <b>HyperStudio</b>
 that also included a programming language similar to HyperText that 
afforded more control over that stacks that were created. Although 
neither of these products gives the user power over details of the 
computer system itself (as does "C" or assembly), it does make it 
possible for a beginner to create programs that have outstanding 
graphics and sound without having to know exactly how the hardware 
produces these effects. This, along with the flexibility possible with 
these products, has led Dennis Doms in an <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah21.html#A2Central">A2-Central</a> feature article to suggest that <b>HyperCard IIGS</b> (and now also possibly <b>HyperStudio</b>) will become the "Applesoft" of the 1990's; that is, an Apple IIGS user with <b>HyperCard IIGS</b> can create programs as easily as the Applesoft programmer of 1980 could do, but with far more attractive results.<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070814133756/http://apple2history.org/history/ah17.html#x11">[11]</a></p>
