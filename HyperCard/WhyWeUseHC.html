"Why I Use HyperCard..."<br>
Online Responses
</div>

<div id="text" align="left">
<p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I use HyperCard in the elementary school where I work to teach children 
to read (with proprietary stackware that I also sell, called AlfaCat), to 
automate test scoring on our English Language Development Test, and to insert 
tabs into the annoyingly tabless reports generated by our Accelerated Reader 
software.  I have caused a number of Macs to be purchased to run my software. 
 Of course if it ceased to run, I would advise to buy cheaper PCs.
<br>     -Salinas, CA, 93901

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I designed various stacks to completely run my business: Rolodex, A/R, 
A/P, Quoting, Order Writing, Invoicing, Analysis of all functions, Deposits, 
etc.
<br>     -Orlando, FL  32860

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I got hooked on HyperCard when I discovered how easy it was to create free 
format databases and add functionality  appropriate to the situation. There 
are many many uses for these free format databases. I use them on their own 
or as front ends and back ends to other applications.
<br>     -Accrington, Lancs, BB5 5BG,   UK

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>It is one of the reasons that I still have a Mac. I use HyperCard for 
keeping track of  any information that I might want to access easily. I won't 
upgrade to OSX if I can't take HyperCard with me. It lets me do it my way.
<br>     -

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>It's just so easy to build all sorts of  very useful tools!  Great user
interface and programming environment.  Expandable using XCMDs. Fast.
You can't beat it for manipulation/reformatting of lists, automatic checking
of Web sites, querying Oracle databases and prototyping user interfaces.


<br>     -University of Huddersfield, UK

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I've been a university teacher for some 25 years (mostly in Japan) and
have been using Macs since I was presented with one of the just-released Mac
Pluses back in the mid-80s.  I first learned of Bill Atkinson and HyperCard
with its "hypertext" capabilities from a Mac magazine, well before HC was
actually born, and I remember waiting with excited anticipation for it to
make its appearance.  I bought it at once and have used it ever since, in
its various versions, to construct and maintain a variety of databases
connected with my work.
   Although I've never had a bit of formal training concerning computers,
much less programming, I quickly taught myself HyperTalk and gained the
capacity to "roll my own" stacks tuned precisely to my specific research and
teaching needs.
   With the exception of my word processor, HC has, without a doubt, been
the most useful piece of software I have ever used -- and I've used (and
struggled with) a good many of them over the years.

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I maintain a web site that has a number of "sub sites" devoted to
information for fans of Elvis Presley: international fan club registry
(addresses, email and web links...), books and publications (including
publishing details and reviews), events around the world, and so on. All the
information is stored in HC stacks and I use HyperTalk to create the HTML
for the individual sites. This way, I create the new HTML ready for FTP
upload literally at the click of a button.<br>     -

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>HyperCard is the 
singularly most powerful tool I've ever encountered for effectively 
making visible those point of language arts instruction which otherwise 
remain obscure abstractions and unintelligible assertions.

HyperCard has allowed me to make my lessons immediate and--to repeat the
 term--visible.

The validation of the educational impact of HyperCard is sustained, 
measurably validated heightened student performance: a sustained + 100 
point increase in SAT verbal averages.<br>     -Horsham, PA 19044-1115

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>We use it as a RAD tool for development of commercially sold vision examination and telemedicine stations.
<br>     -Pittsburgh PA 15221

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I used HyperCard to
 create People(tm), a personal information manager for the Mac.  
Distributed as shareware, it is seeing a lot of activity and the user 
base is growing fast.  HyperCard allowed an average person like myself 
to get started easily and grow into a serious programmer.  HyperCard is 
incredible.

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I use HyperCard for personal productivity programs, and to develop a

essentially, a purchasing/inventory control/sales/product management system 
for plants.

development.  I wish the color tools were better integrated, however,

help to understand better what people tell me. When I listen to someone I
 try to picture them using stacks and links, and see how they jump from 
one stack to the other and back. I also use it as my window into my 
Macintosh World, developing prototypes for testing my ideas. It's a 
wonderful hobby collecting stacks... much like someone else might 
collect stamps.

for presentations, esp. in schools. I have done entire projects in 
HyperCard, in many different subjects. HyperCard is really easy to use, 
too.

I cannot wait until HyperCard for OS X comes out!<br>     -Brantford/Ontario/N3R 6M8

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I have been using 
HyperCard since 1989 to create interactive college level music 
curriculum software, keep track of my piano tuning clients, private 
students, Macintosh computer repair work, and shareware registrations. I
 use it to create church presentations, and do mock ups of programs that
 are later completed in C.  I use HyperCard on a weekly if not daily 
basis.  I am very disappointed that Apple has discontinued development 
of HyperCard 3.0.  I really looked forward to it.

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I use HyperCard for
 a number of varied specialized applications that have no commercial 
equivalent. One of them is running the information display (slide show) 
at a major local public event here in Fort Wayne every November. I've 
considered porting it to PowerPoint but PP won't allow the dynamic 
updating, sorting and custom card building that we need.

HyperCard is a also great tool for learning programming.

HyperCard is one of Apple's hidden treasures and it needs to be upgraded
 and better publicized.<br>     -Fort Wayne, IN 46815

Also, my company (a small newspaper,) runs it's entire editorial

from a Danish company called SAXoTech.  You may want to seek out their 
opinions on HyperCard as well.

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>I see HyperTalk as 
the ideal language for teaching programming to High School students, 
specifically programming for students interested in science. 

It is best if the programming output is in graphical form, that is, if 
one is trying to determine the orbit of Jupiter around the sun, it is 
best to draw the orbit rather than print out a mass of numerical 
coordinates. It is necessary therefore to augment HT with Turtle 
Graphics easily accomplished and created as a stack for students to use 
as HT plus (that is plus Turtle Graphics.)

I  have written text to complement this HT plus stack. <br>     -Nevada City, CA 95959

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>Cuz I want it to be the 'visualbasic'-killer for OSX(Cocoa)!

Sorry, that means no carbon: the point of porting legacy apps is to
leverage Apple I/P on a going-forward basis, in order to _add value_ to
OSX itself ... not to provide backward compatibility to Classic!<br>     -ottawa ca

</p><p><img src="WhyWeUseHC_files/HyperTiny.jpg"><br>HyperCard is the best way for me to build applications I need for myself.
Since I got my first Mac (1988) I've successfully created solutions I need.
(Like my cooking, they're OK for me, but nobody else should have to use
them!) Over time they have become quite elaborate as I add functionality
(and fix bugs.) HyperTalk is very easy to ramp up with again as I start a
new project after a layoff from using it.

An OS X version would be great!!!

Macs rule partly because HyperCard is so great.
