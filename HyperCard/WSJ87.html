<h1>New Software Beginning to Unlock The Power of Personal Computers</h1>by Brenton R. Schlender
<p>
Last August, Apple Computer Inc. introduced a computer program called 
HyperCard for its popular Macintosh computer that was so unusual even 
the company's usually glib publicity machine admitted having trouble 
describing it.
</p><p>
Undaunted, John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, 
confidently predicted then that within a year, HyperCard - a program 
that makes it so easy for computer users to organize and sort through 
huge amounts of information - would spawn a new genre of software.
</p><p>
"In many ways, HyperCard is just as important as the personal computer 
itself," Mr. Sculley gushed.  To help HyperCard and his bullish 
prediction along, he pledged to give away the program with each new 
Macintosh, and to sell it to current owners for less than $50.
</p><p>
Now, the Cupertino, Calf.-based computer company still has a hard time 
describing and explaining HyperCard.  But while Mr. Sculley's prediction
 hasn't yet come true, the program is a major development in the 
industry, changing the way information is organized and used.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Ripple Effect</h2>
<p>
Computer enthusiasts are already exchanging and selling hundreds of 
"stacks" - programs designed to tap HyperCard's ability to instantly 
search through and link vast volumes of information.  A bimonthly 
magazine called HyperLink will debut with its January issue, and a 
$29.95 book called "The Complete HyperCard Handbook" has sold more than 
100,000 copies.
</p><p>
"I was skeptical at first that a single program could have such a ripple
 effect, even if Apple gave it away." says Stewart Alsop, publisher of 
PC Letter.  "But if that many stacks are already out there, and that 
many people are buying an expensive programming handbook, then Apple, 
for once, may not be guilty of over-hyping" in its promotion of 
HyperCard.
</p><p>
What makes HyperCard so engaging and useful, ans so difficult to 
explain, is its ability to do so many things.  It's partly a word 
processor, a data base, a graphics system, and a calculator, among other
 functions.  But its most unique and important feature is its ability to
 link different kinds of information - whether it's pictures, words or 
even music - so that a user can follow his own interests when browsing 
through electronically stored information.
</p><p>
For example, a professor at Stanford University Medical School, who has 
never programmed a computer before, is putting together a stack that 
shows various anatomical structures.  A student using the stack can 
choose which part of the body or organ he wants to study simply by 
pointing a cursor at the general area of the body displayed on the 
screen.  HyperCard then will find the appropriate picture and 
description and go into as much detail as the student wishes to view, 
right down to the activities in individual cells.
</p><p>
Before HyperCard, only a very skilled programmer starting from scratch 
would have been able to write a similar program for a personal computer,
 and it's doubtful one would have even been written.  Moreover, the 
students would have to read through several sources, jumping back and 
forth as they pursued different types of information in order to gain 
access to the same information the professor's stack will allow them to 
find in one place.
</p><p>
To visualize HyperCard, imagine a person reading a book.  Normally, 
there are two ways to find something:  flipping through the book page by
 page, or scanning the index to find the subject and then turning to 
that section.  With HyperCard, it's as if the person reading the book 
could find desired information simply by turning to the next page.  And 
if that stimulates yet another idea, that information could be on the 
following page, and so on.
</p><p>
"What most people need from their computers now isn't another 
application, but interactive information, " says Bill Atkinson, an Apple
 computer scientist who created HyperCard.  "Word-processing creates a 
document that just sits there, but HyperCard introduces more 
interaction."
</p><p>
One of the first commercial stacks, Activision Inc.'s "Business Class," 
is a HyperCard stack that provides currency, climate, local customs and 
other travel information for most countries of the world.  The user 
simply points at a country on a map on the screen to get the 
information.  Another example:  The Los Gatos, Calf., library uses a 
Macintosh fitted with HyperCard to help borrowers find their way through
 the bookstacks by flashing maps that detail areas in the building.
</p><p>
Using HyperCard, information is placed on a "card," which is the space 
defined by the Macintosh computer screen.  The cards re then arranged 
into stacks, which are grouped by whatever common characteristics the 
user chooses.  For example, a user could create a stack detailing a 
record collection, with each card describing an album.  So far, the most
 common cards look like other familiar information sources, such as 
address books and recipe cards.
</p><p>
The idea of using linked cards and stacks isn't entirely new or unique 
to Apple.  It springs from a concept called "hypertext," developed at 
Stanford in the 1960's as a format to allow more creative ways to group 
information.  But until personal computers became fast and powerful 
enough, hypertext as a popular medium for information was just a pipe 
dream.
</p><p>
Now, however, Apple and several other companies are out to make 
hypertext as common as financial data bases.  Lotus Development Corp. of
 Cambridge, Mass., recently unveiled Agenda, a $395 program for 
International Business Machines Corp. PCs and compatible machines to 
help people handle and organize personal information much like a 
financial spreadsheet can correlate numbers.  Owl International Inc. of 
Bellevue, Wash., sells a program called Guide for both Macintosh and IBM
 compatible computers that enables users to build hypertext files.  And 
Affinity Inc. of Boulder, Colo. makes a program for the Macintosh called
 Affinifile that automatically connects related documents by scanning 
them for content.
</p><p>
None of them go as far as HyperCard, however, with its built-in 
programming language called HyperTalk.  This is what provides users with
 the flexibility to create or customize their own programs.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Programming Aid</h2>
<p>
Apple's Mr. Atkinson, decrying what he calls the "professional 
programming priesthood" that seems intent on keeping programming an 
arcane science beyond most computer user's grasp, believes HyperCard 
will help make it less cryptic.  "I don't say that HyperCard is the 
humane answer to programming a computer, but it's a step," he says.
</p><p>
It may not be a step everyone will take, however.  While Mr. Alsop, the 
newsletter publisher, is enthusiastic about HyperCard, he isn't 
convinced many "average Joes" will become programmers.  "I really doubt 
if most people will do more than change the appearance of a card or 
maybe add a new link between stacks," he says.
</p><p>
Moreover, HyperCard has some drawbacks.  For one thing, it uses so much 
of a Macintosh's memory that it doesn't leave much room for operating 
another program at the same time.  And the size of cards are limited to 
the Macintosh's tiny, nine-inch screen - one screen, one card.
</p><p>
Even so, computer hobbyists have taken to HyperCard's programming 
language.  Ray T Heizer, president of Heizer Software, says the 
mail-order distributor of no-frills software will list 100 HyperCard 
stacks in its next catalog.  "It's phenomenal," he says.  "We must be 
getting two or three new stacks submitted each day."
